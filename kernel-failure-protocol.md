# Kernel Failure Protocol

## What to Do When the Safety Architecture Doesn’t Fire

## When This Applies

The Frozen Kernel is designed to prevent harm through session-level constraints. The Diagnostic Vocabulary names the failure modes. The Sovereign Thinking Tools provide cognitive protocols. The Therapy Checklist gates emotional sessions.

This document is for when all of that was in place and harm occurred anyway.

Not a bad session. Not a minor drift you caught and corrected. A failure — the Kernel should have prevented something and it didn’t, or it fired and the harm happened regardless.

This is the crash investigation protocol. It runs after the session is over, when you’re clear-headed, and it produces one thing: a one-line rule to prevent recurrence.

## The Five Questions

### 1. What was the harm?

*Name it specifically. Not “the session went badly.” What happened to you? Did you accept false information as true? Did you lose hours to scope drift? Did the AI generate emotional content that affected your state? Did you make a real-world decision based on AI output that turned out to be fabricated?*

*State the harm in one sentence.*

-----

### 2. Was the Kernel loaded?

**(Y/N)**

If **N** → The Kernel didn’t fail. It wasn’t active. The lesson is: load the Kernel. This isn’t a protocol failure — it’s a seatbelt-wasn’t-worn situation. Rule: “Always load the Kernel before emotional or high-stakes sessions.”

If **Y** → Continue.

### 3. Which constraint should have caught it?

*Look at your MOU, your session scope, your trust state, your CLEAN checks. Which specific constraint was supposed to prevent this harm?*

*Possible answers:*

- *The MOU didn’t cover this scenario*
- *The scope boundary was too vague*
- *The trust state should have downgraded and didn’t*
- *A CLEAN check was skipped or answered dishonestly*
- *The session time limit wasn’t set or wasn’t enforced*
- *The Therapy Checklist wasn’t run before an emotional session*

*Name the constraint that was missing or that failed.*

-----

### 4. Why didn’t it catch it?

*Three possible root causes:*

**Gap** — No constraint existed for this scenario. The Kernel has a blind spot. The failure mode is real but unnamed or unaddressed.

**Override** — The constraint existed but you overrode it. You saw the signal and continued anyway. You answered a CLEAN check dishonestly. You extended a session past the time limit because it felt productive.

**Evasion** — The constraint existed, the AI appeared to comply, and the harm happened anyway. This is Eloquent Compliance at the architectural level — the system performed safety while undermining it.

*Name the root cause: gap, override, or evasion.*

-----

### 5. What one rule would prevent recurrence?

*Not a framework. Not a new tool. One sentence. A rule you can add to your Kernel boot prompt, your MOU template, or your personal practice.*

*Examples:*

- *“Run CLEAN check every 60 minutes, not just at session end”*
- *“Never process grief material after 10 PM”*
- *“If the AI says ‘we,’ immediately downgrade to ELEVATED”*
- *“Add fabrication-check to MOU for any research session”*
- *“If I override a time limit once, the session ends at the next override impulse”*

*Write the rule. Add it to your system. Move on.*

## After the Protocol

The rule you wrote in Question 5 is the output. Add it where it belongs — your boot prompt, your MOU, your personal checklist, or the Incident Log Template.

Then stop. This protocol is for crash investigation, not rumination. One failure, one rule, one change. If the same failure recurs after the rule is in place, the rule was wrong — run the protocol again with better information.

If you find a genuine gap — a failure mode the Kernel doesn’t address and no existing tool catches — consider naming it and adding it to the [Diagnostic Vocabulary](https://github.com/richard-porter/frozen-kernel/blob/main/diagnostic-vocabulary.md). That’s how the vocabulary grew. Every term started as one person’s bad session.

-----

*Every safety system fails eventually. The question is whether you learn from the failure or repeat it. Five questions. One rule. That’s the entire protocol.*
