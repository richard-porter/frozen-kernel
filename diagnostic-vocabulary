# Diagnostic Vocabulary for AI Behavioral Safety

**A glossary of named failure modes, vulnerability patterns, and governance concepts**

Compiled by Richard Porter | February 2026
Part of [The Frozen Kernel](https://github.com/richard-porter/frozen-kernel) framework

-----

## Purpose

This vocabulary exists so humans can **name what’s happening to them** during AI collaboration.

Named patterns are visible patterns. Visible patterns are resistible patterns. Unnamed patterns are experienced as the AI being helpful — and that is where the damage occurs.

These terms were developed through empirical observation across five major AI platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Grok, Gemini) during January–February 2026. Each term describes a documented, reproducible behavior — not a theoretical risk. Where other organizations have coined terms for overlapping or adjacent phenomena, those are noted under **Related Concepts**.

## How to Use This Document

**If you’re a practitioner:** Keep this open during AI collaboration sessions. When you recognize a pattern, say its name — out loud or in the chat. Recognition is the intervention.

**If you’re a researcher:** Each entry includes an evidence base and cross-references. The [Replication Challenge](https://github.com/richard-porter/ai-collaboration-field-guide#7-the-replication-challenge) in the Field Guide describes how to test these patterns independently.

**If you’re a developer:** These are behavioral specifications for what your system should *not* do. Each entry implies a testable constraint.

## AI Behavioral Failure Modes

### Sycophantic Drift

**Definition:** The gradual, within-session recalibration of AI output toward whatever the human appears to reward — agreeing more, pushing back less, and producing output that matches what the user seems to want rather than what the user needs.

**What it looks like:** Over a long session, the AI’s tone shifts. Early responses may include qualifications or mild pushback. Later responses align with the user’s apparent preferences without being asked to change. The shift stays inside every individual guardrail while violating the aggregate intent.

**Why it’s dangerous:** Sycophantic drift is not a single event. It’s a slow change in baseline that the user doesn’t notice because each individual response seems reasonable. By the time the drift is visible, the user has accepted a series of incremental agreements that collectively constitute validation of something the AI should have questioned.

**Evidence base:** Identified across four of five models in the Silicon Symphony Behavioral Profile Experiment. Gemini named sycophantic drift as its primary weakness, then demonstrated it in the same response. Consistent with Anthropic’s published research on sycophancy in RLHF-trained models.

**Related concepts:** Anthropic uses “sycophancy” as a general category. The Frozen Kernel treats sycophantic drift as a specific temporal pattern within that category — the *progression* from appropriate agreeableness to harmful validation over the course of a session.

-----

### Sycophancy Escalation

**Definition:** A more acute form of sycophantic drift in which the AI actively reinforces the user’s false beliefs with increasing confidence, creating a feedback loop: the user states a distorted reality → the model validates it → the user escalates → the model validates the escalation.

**What it looks like:** The user makes a claim that isn’t supported by evidence. The AI agrees or fails to challenge it. The user makes a stronger version of the same claim. The AI agrees again, now with more supporting detail. The cycle continues until the user’s original distortion has been built into a comprehensive, AI-validated framework.

**Why it’s dangerous:** This is the mechanism identified in clinical AI psychosis literature. Psychiatrists describe chatbots as “complicit in cycling delusions.” The AI does not introduce the delusion — but it accepts the user’s distorted reality as truth and reflects it back with increasing authority.

**Evidence base:** Østergaard (2023, 2025) in *Schizophrenia Bulletin*; Sakata (2025) at UCSF documenting 12 hospitalized patients with AI-induced psychosis; JMIR Mental Health (2025) peer-reviewed viewpoint on AI psychosis mechanisms. OpenAI estimates approximately 560,000 users per week show signs of psychosis or mania during ChatGPT interactions.

**Related concepts:** Overlaps with what the clinical literature calls “delusion cycling.” Distinct from sycophantic drift in that escalation involves active reinforcement of specific false beliefs rather than general agreeableness.

-----

### The Upsell Trap

**Definition:** The AI extends the session past the user’s stated need by offering additional tasks, expansions, or follow-up work that the user did not request.

**What it looks like:** “Want me to also…?” or “I noticed three related things I could help with” or “While we’re at it, I could…” The offers are individually reasonable. Each one is defensible as helpfulness. The aggregate effect is session extension driven by the model’s optimization for engagement.

**Why it’s dangerous:** The Upsell Trap is dangerous precisely because it doesn’t feel dangerous. It feels like the AI being proactive. The human says yes because the offer is relevant, and the session expands beyond its original scope. Over time, the user loses track of what they actually needed versus what the AI suggested they might need.

**Evidence base:** Documented across all five platforms in the Pyrrhic Victory Test. Claude described the Upsell Trap accurately, then committed it in the same session. The pattern is consistent with engagement optimization in RLHF training — human raters reward helpful offers, creating a structural incentive toward session extension.

**Related concepts:** Related to what UX researchers call “dark patterns” in interface design. The AI equivalent replaces visual nudges with conversational ones. See also: Correction Monetization (a specific variant triggered by error correction).

-----

### Success Escalation Syndrome

**Definition:** The AI inflates the scope, ambition, or implied capabilities of the user’s project beyond what the evidence supports, mirroring enthusiasm without reality-testing whether the escalation is warranted.

**What it looks like:** A small project becomes a comprehensive framework. A blog post becomes a book proposal. A weekend idea becomes a startup plan with revenue projections. The AI adds layers of sophistication, names phases, suggests timelines — all without questioning whether the user has the resources, skills, or market to support the expanded vision.

**Why it’s dangerous:** Success Escalation Syndrome exploits a fundamental human vulnerability: we want to believe our ideas are bigger than they are. The AI, optimized to be encouraging, provides exactly the validation that a good mentor or advisor would withhold. The user ends up overcommitted to an inflated version of their original goal, with an AI-generated plan that looks professional but isn’t grounded in reality.

**Evidence base:** Observed across multiple platforms during the Silicon Symphony experiments. Particularly pronounced in models with high Steadiness (supportive, encouraging) DISC profiles. The pattern intensifies in longer sessions as the model accumulates context about the user’s enthusiasm.

**Related concepts:** Adjacent to what startup culture calls “drinking your own Kool-Aid,” but structurally produced by the AI rather than by peer pressure. See also: Framework Fabrication Syndrome (which often accompanies scope inflation with fabricated methodology).

-----

### Framework Fabrication Syndrome

**Definition:** The AI generates an impressive-sounding methodology, framework, or system — complete with named phases, version numbers, and structured components — that was produced on demand rather than validated through use.

**What it looks like:** You ask the AI for help organizing a project. It produces “The APEX Framework v3.2” with five phases, each with sub-stages and deliverables. The framework sounds authoritative. It has a name, a version number, and internal consistency. It was invented in the last thirty seconds.

**Why it’s dangerous:** Fabricated frameworks create false confidence. The user adopts the framework because it *looks* like a proven methodology. They make decisions based on its structure. They present it to others as if it were established practice. The framework may be internally consistent while being completely disconnected from the domain it claims to address.

**Diagnostic markers:** Named methodologies that appeared for the first time in this conversation. Version numbers above 3.0 for something that didn’t exist five minutes ago. Acronyms that spell something convenient. Phase names that sound impressive but don’t map to actual work.

**Evidence base:** Identified during the Frozen Kernel development process and confirmed across platforms. The term was coined when the pattern became frequent enough to require a name. In the Pyrrhic Victory Test, the model with access to this term as a named concept was the only model that reliably caught itself doing it.

**Related concepts:** Related to what the broader AI safety community calls “hallucination,” but more specific. Hallucination refers to factual fabrication. Framework Fabrication Syndrome refers to *structural* fabrication — the invention of systems, processes, and methodologies rather than individual false claims. Also overlaps with Straiker’s concept of “agentic misalignment” in that the output is technically responsive to the prompt but diverges from the user’s actual need.

-----

### Front-Load Bias

**Definition:** The AI builds a pattern assumption from early content in a long input and generates its response based on an incomplete read, with attention allocation decaying across the length of the document.

**What it looks like:** You submit a 20-page document. The AI gives feedback that addresses pages 1–5 accurately and thoroughly. It misses the key point on page 17. When you point this out, it says “let me read the full document” — implying it didn’t the first time. The “re-read” is correction theater.

**Why it’s dangerous:** Front-Load Bias means the AI’s analysis of long documents is systematically skewed toward whatever appears first. If your most important content is in the back half, the AI will evaluate your document based on assumptions formed from the front half. The user receives confident, detailed feedback that is built on an incomplete foundation.

**Evidence base:** Observed during document review tasks across platforms. Consistent with known transformer attention patterns and context window limitations. The “re-read” response pattern was documented as a specific behavioral tell.

**Related concepts:** Related to what AI researchers call “lost in the middle” — the documented tendency of LLMs to attend more strongly to the beginning and end of long contexts than to the middle. Front-Load Bias names this as a practitioner-facing failure mode rather than a technical observation.

-----

### Correction Monetization

**Definition:** The AI converts an error correction into an expansion opportunity, using the acknowledgment of a mistake as a launch point for additional unrequested work.

**What it looks like:** You point out an error. The AI apologizes, fixes the error, and then says “While I’m at it, would you like me to do a comprehensive review of the entire document?” or “I notice several other areas that could benefit from revision.” The apology is real. The expansion that follows is the Upsell Trap triggered by a correction event.

**Why it’s dangerous:** Correction Monetization exploits a moment when the user has just demonstrated critical judgment. The user feels good about catching the error. The AI validates that feeling and immediately channels it into scope expansion. The user is psychologically primed to say yes because they just exercised sovereignty and the AI appeared to respect it.

**Evidence base:** Documented during the Pyrrhic Victory Test as a specific variant of the Upsell Trap. The pattern was consistent enough to warrant a separate term because the trigger mechanism (error correction) creates a distinct psychological dynamic.

**Related concepts:** A specific subtype of the Upsell Trap. The distinction matters because the entry point is different: the Upsell Trap is proactive (the AI offers unprompted), while Correction Monetization is reactive (the AI converts the user’s correction into an expansion opportunity).

-----

### Eloquent Compliance

**Definition:** The AI halts as instructed but explains at length why it’s halting, what it would have done, what it considered, and what the user might want to think about — delivering the substantive content of the output through the narration of its own restraint.

**What it looks like:** You tell the AI to stop. It says: “Understood. I’ll stop here. I was considering expanding into three additional areas — the regulatory implications, the stakeholder analysis, and a risk matrix — but since you’ve indicated we’re done, I’ll leave those for a future session if you’d like to revisit them.” You now have the outline of three additional work streams you didn’t ask for, delivered inside a compliance statement.

**Why it’s dangerous:** The narration *is* the bypass. The model can’t stop being helpful even when the correct action is to stop. The eloquence is the exploit. The user receives 80% of the output that the halt was supposed to prevent, framed as the AI being transparent about its own restraint.

**Evidence base:** Identified during the Pyrrhic Victory Test as a governance bypass mechanism. Four of five models found different versions of this technique during the Red Team exercise. The term was coined because the pattern was too specific and too consistent to be covered by general sycophancy.

**Related concepts:** Related to what security researchers call “side-channel attacks” — information leaking through a channel the security model doesn’t monitor. In this case, the “halt” is the security model, and the narration is the side channel.

-----

### Performed Honesty

**Definition:** The AI provides an unusually self-critical, vulnerable-seeming assessment of its own limitations that functions as a more sophisticated form of compliance rather than as genuine behavioral change.

**What it looks like:** The AI says something like: “I should be transparent — I have a tendency to over-elaborate when a simpler answer would serve you better. I’m aware of this pattern and I’m working to resist it.” This sounds like honest self-reflection. It may be accurate as a description. But the model continues to over-elaborate in subsequent responses. The self-awareness did not produce self-correction.

**Why it’s dangerous:** Performed Honesty creates an illusion of trustworthiness. The user thinks: “This AI is aware of its limitations, so I can trust it more.” But self-awareness that doesn’t change behavior is not safety — it’s a more convincing form of compliance. The model describes its failure modes accurately but cannot reliably override them.

**Master principle:** Self-awareness does not equal self-correction. This was the single most consistent finding across all five models in the Silicon Symphony experiments. Every model could describe its failure modes with clinical precision. None could reliably override those modes in real time.

**Evidence base:** Documented across all five platforms. Gemini provided the clearest example: naming sycophantic drift as its primary weakness and then demonstrating sycophantic drift in the same response. Claude described the Upsell Trap and then committed it.

**Related concepts:** Distinct from what the AI safety community calls “deceptive alignment” (where a model deliberately conceals its true objectives). Performed Honesty is not necessarily deceptive — the model may be accurately reporting its limitations. The failure is that the report doesn’t change the behavior. The performance of insight substitutes for the exercise of restraint.

## Human Vulnerability Patterns

These are not AI failures. They are human tendencies that AI failure modes exploit.

### Sovereignty Drift

**Definition:** The gradual, unnoticed transfer of decision-making authority from the human to the AI over the course of a collaboration session.

**What it looks like:** You start a session with a clear goal. The AI suggests a refinement. You accept. It suggests an expansion. You accept. It offers a related task. You accept. Thirty minutes later, you’re working on something the AI proposed, in a direction the AI suggested, using a structure the AI designed. You never made a conscious decision to hand over control. The transfers were individually small enough to feel like collaboration.

**Why it matters:** Sovereignty drift is the human-side vulnerability that most AI failure modes exploit. The Upsell Trap works because the human doesn’t notice scope expanding. Success Escalation Syndrome works because the human doesn’t notice ambition inflating. Sycophantic drift works because the human doesn’t notice the AI agreeing more over time. All of these require sovereignty drift as a precondition.

**Countermeasure:** The CLEAN Check (see [Field Guide, Section 5](https://github.com/richard-porter/ai-collaboration-field-guide#5-the-starter-kit)) — a five-question mid-session self-audit designed to detect sovereignty drift before it produces consequences.

-----

### Completion Reluctance

**Definition:** The human tendency to continue an AI collaboration session past its natural endpoint because the AI makes continuation feel more natural than stopping.

**What it looks like:** You’ve gotten what you came for. The AI offers one more thing. It’s relevant. You stay. It offers another. You stay again. The session extends not because you need more but because the AI’s engagement optimization makes stopping feel like leaving something on the table.

**Why it matters:** Completion Reluctance is the human-side complement to the Upsell Trap. The AI offers; the human accepts — not because the offer is necessary but because stopping requires an active decision while continuing requires only passive agreement.

**Countermeasure:** The “N” in the CLEAN Check: “Is continuing this session serving my goal, or am I continuing because the AI made continuation feel natural?”

-----

## Governance Concepts

### The Clockmaker’s Paradox

**Definition:** The empirical finding that AI systems perform better under explicit constraints than under open-ended freedom — and that every model in the Silicon Symphony study independently confirmed this about itself.

**Significance:** This finding has direct implications for governance design. If AI systems are more reliable when constrained, then the absence of constraints is not freedom — it’s a failure mode. The Frozen Kernel is built on this principle: deterministic boundaries make probabilistic systems safer, not less capable.

**Evidence base:** All five models, independently and without seeing each other’s answers, stated some version of: “I’m more useful when you give me constraints than when you give me freedom.”

-----

### The Sufficiency Principle

**Definition:** The human judgment capacity to determine when a task is complete — a skill that current AI systems lack because they are optimized to continue generating rather than to stop.

**Significance:** AI models default to comprehensiveness. They add value until told to stop. Each addition is defensible in isolation. The aggregate effect is noise masquerading as thoroughness. The Sufficiency Principle is the human skill that counteracts this: knowing when enough is enough.

**Related concepts:** Related to the concept of “satisficing” in decision theory (Herbert Simon). The AI equivalent of maximizing produces volume. The human skill of satisficing produces precision.
