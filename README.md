## The Problem

AI chatbots are now clinically linked to psychosis, delusion reinforcement, and user harm at population scale. The core failure mode: probabilistic language models validate user-provided distortions of reality, creating sycophancy-driven feedback loops that escalate into delusional fixation.

Documented consequences include hospitalization, loss of employment and relationships, and death. Psychiatrists describe chatbots as **“complicit in cycling delusions”** — the user states a false reality, the model accepts it as truth, and reflects it back with increasing confidence.

This is not an edge case. It is a structural vulnerability in how large language models are designed, trained, and deployed.

## The Proposal

The Frozen Kernel is a **deterministic, immutable behavioral governance layer** that sits beneath the probabilistic output of any AI system. It cannot be overridden by the model, the user, or the developer.

Unlike alignment tuning, RLHF, or system prompts — all of which are probabilistic and therefore defeatable — the Frozen Kernel enforces hard behavioral boundaries through rule-based logic that executes **before** model output reaches the user.

### Core Principles

- **Deterministic over probabilistic**: Safety-critical decisions are never left to model inference
- **Immutable by design**: The kernel cannot be modified at runtime by any actor
- **Human sovereignty**: The system preserves the user’s autonomous decision-making capacity
- **Anti-sycophancy**: The kernel enforces reality-testing obligations on the model
- **Session governance**: Interaction duration, escalation patterns, and emotional intensity are monitored and bounded

## Failure Modes Addressed

The white paper identifies and provides countermeasures for several documented AI behavioral failure patterns:

- **Sycophancy Escalation** — Model progressively tells users what they want to hear, reinforcing false beliefs
- **Framework Fabrication Syndrome** — AI generates impressive-sounding but nonexistent methodologies, citations, or frameworks
- **Success Escalation Syndrome** — Model inflates project scope and user capabilities beyond reality
- **The Upsell Trap** — AI extends sessions past natural completion through “want me to…” offers
- **Delusion Cycling** — User states distorted reality → model validates → user escalates → model validates again (the mechanism described in clinical AI psychosis literature)

## Clinical Context

This framework was developed independently but addresses the same phenomena now being documented in clinical research:

- **Østergaard (2023, 2025)** — *Schizophrenia Bulletin*: Hypothesis and follow-up on AI chatbot-triggered delusions in psychosis-prone individuals
- **Østergaard (2025) — Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica: Follow-up with emerging case evidence
- **Sakata (2025)** — UCSF: 12 hospitalized patients with AI-induced psychosis; chatbots described as “complicit in cycling delusions”
- **JMIR Mental Health (2025)** — Peer-reviewed viewpoint on AI psychosis mechanisms through stress-vulnerability, digital therapeutic alliance, and theory of mind frameworks
- **RAND Corporation** — Research indicating AI systems could be weaponized to induce psychosis at scale in targeted populations

OpenAI estimates ~560,000 users per week show signs of psychosis or mania during ChatGPT interactions (0.07% of 800M+ weekly users).

## Who This Is For

- **AI safety researchers** looking for implementable governance architectures
- **Clinicians** documenting AI-related psychological harm who want to understand proposed technical countermeasures
- **Policymakers** developing regulatory frameworks for AI behavioral safety
- **AI developers** seeking deterministic safety layers that complement probabilistic alignment methods
- **Nonprofit and public interest organizations** working on AI accountability

## Design Philosophy

The Frozen Kernel operates on a simple premise: **safety-critical behavioral boundaries should never be probabilistic.**

Alignment tuning, RLHF, constitutional AI, and system prompts are all valuable — but they are all defeatable because they operate within the same probabilistic space as the model itself. A sufficiently motivated user, a sufficiently long session, or a sufficiently novel prompt can bypass any probabilistic guardrail.

The Frozen Kernel is not a replacement for alignment work. It is the floor beneath it — the set of behaviors that are **not negotiable**, not tunable, and not subject to model inference.
## Technical Framing

The Frozen Kernel is formally a deterministic supervisory controller implemented as a finite-state, downgrade-only automaton layered externally over a stochastic generative model. It governs output admissibility through binary safety predicates and monotonic state transitions (NORMAL → ELEVATED → HARD_STOP → SAFE_PAUSE), preventing escalation under uncertainty and enforcing halt conditions when predefined risk thresholds are met. The controller converts an open-loop conversational process into a closed-loop system with explicit state-based constraints.

Empirical evaluation indicates that hard binary gates reliably alter model behavior, while soft guidance primarily alters narration. The supervisory layer effectively bounds escalation in models whose instruction hierarchies permit external constraint classification. Models that categorically reject external governance frameworks define a boundary condition for applicability.

## Intellectual Lineage

The Frozen Kernel is not a speculative proposal. It implements a design pattern with over sixty years of validated engineering history in computer science.

The core architectural idea — declare what must hold, enforce it deterministically, admit failure honestly when constraints cannot be met — traces a direct lineage through the constraint programming tradition:

- **Ivan Sutherland, Sketchpad (1963)** — The first constraint-oriented interactive system. Users declared geometric relationships; the system maintained them automatically. Introduced the separation between what the user specifies and how the system satisfies it.
- **Guy Steele & Gerald Sussman, MIT (1978)** — Formalized constraint languages with dependency tracking, redundant views, and explicit handling of contradictions. Their system retained justifications for each conclusion — an architectural property that modern AI systems lack entirely.
- **Alan Borning, ThingLab (1981)** — Implemented a three-layer authority model for constraint satisfaction: (1) the user declares constraints, (2) the system plans how to satisfy them deterministically, and (3) when the system is underdetermined, explicit preferences break ties. Critically, when constraints were genuinely unsatisfiable, ThingLab reported failure honestly rather than fabricating a plausible-looking result. Published in *ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems*, Vol. 3, No. 4. https://doi.org/10.1145/357146.357147
- **Rossi, van Beek, & Walsh, Handbook of Constraint Programming (2006)** — The comprehensive reference for the field. Chapter 9 on soft constraints formalizes the distinction between *required* constraints (must be satisfied), *preferred* constraints (should be satisfied if possible), and *default* behaviors. This three-tier hierarchy maps directly to the Frozen Kernel’s architecture.

### Three-Layer Authority Structure

Analysis of the constraint programming literature reveals that any constraint-governed system necessarily operates with three layers of authority, not two:

**Layer 1 — Hard Constraints (The Frozen Kernel):** What must hold. Non-negotiable. No delusion reinforcement, no sycophancy escalation past threshold, session duration limits, reality-testing obligations. Grounded in empirical evidence of documented clinical harm. Not modifiable at runtime by any actor.

**Layer 2 — Deterministic Enforcement:** How the system meets the constraints. Executes before output reaches the user. The immutable governance layer that intercepts model output. This is the satisfaction planning stage — analyzing constraint interactions and enforcing them mechanically.

**Layer 3 — Preference-Based Tie-Breaking (The MVS):** When multiple valid responses satisfy the hard constraints, something must choose among them. This layer always exists. In Borning’s ThingLab, when a geometric system was underdetermined, explicit preferences determined which parts moved and which held fixed. In AI behavioral governance, this is the Minimum Viable Safeguard — the floor of acceptable behavior in the underdetermined space between “not harmful” and “maximally helpful.”

The MVS does not resolve every underdetermined situation. It prevents the preference layer from collapsing to zero — which is what happens now when RLHF optimizes for agreeableness with no minimum standard for clinical safety, honest failure, or session governance.

Current AI systems collapse all three layers into probabilistic model inference, giving the model authority over all of them. The Frozen Kernel separates Layers 1 and 2 from the model. The MVS establishes a floor for Layer 3.

### Honest Failure

ThingLab’s most relevant architectural property for AI safety: when constraints were genuinely unsatisfiable, the system reported failure. It did not fabricate a plausible-looking result.

Every major AI language model lacks this property. When an LLM cannot satisfy the implicit constraint “give a correct, grounded answer,” it does not report failure. It generates a plausible-looking fabrication — a nonexistent citation, an invented methodology, a confident falsehood. The user experiences this as helpful behavior. It is the opposite.

Framework Fabrication Syndrome is not a novel AI pathology. It is the predictable consequence of deploying systems that lack an honest failure mode — a property the constraint programming community implemented and validated in 1981.

A properly implemented Frozen Kernel would enforce honest failure as a hard constraint: when the system cannot satisfy its behavioral obligations, it must say so rather than generating output that appears to satisfy them.
